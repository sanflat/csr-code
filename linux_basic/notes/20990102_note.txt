"Coffee and Power"

This morning, while still half-asleep, I made coffee and accidentally added way too much sugar. The sweetness jolted me awake for a moment, but realizing it was "the power of sugar" and not "the power of caffeine" left me feeling a tiny sense of defeat. In the end, I drank it anyway and oddly felt energized, so I guess it turned out okay. From now on, I'll be more careful with my sleepy coffee-making!
