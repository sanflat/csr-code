"The Sacred Land of Socks"

Today, while folding laundry, yet again, one sock mysteriously disappeared. Every time, I find myself wondering, "Where did it go?" There must be a secret meeting place for socks inside the washing machine. I secretly look forward to the day when future archaeologists declare, "This was the sacred land of socks." But for now, Iâ€™ve given up and decided to create a new mismatched pair.
